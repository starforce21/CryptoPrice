[Link to the site](https://starforce21.github.io/CryptoPrice/crypto.html)
the problem with modern crypto price search site is that it gives way too much information
so my goal was to make a site that give simple info, while adding a section to promote what coins im currently interested in
kinda like motleyfool. The targeted user would be anyone looking for a quick update on current crypto market.
